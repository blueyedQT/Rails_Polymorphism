1.  Create a new model for comments
	
	rails g model Comment user:references comment:text table:references
	-Changed the Comment migration file to include "polymorphic: true"
	-Added "has_many :comments, as: :table" to each model that would have comments
	rake db:migrate

2.  Tested out each to see if I could add comments to them

	Comment.create(user:User.first, comment:"This is the first comment ever", table:Blog.find(2))
	...
	Working for all!  Shows the table_id and table_type!

3.  Here is the git link if you would like to try it yourself! :D
